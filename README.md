My all time favourite Chocolate Chip Cookies. These amazing cookies are made using melted butter, with the help of butter they're extra soft and chewy, with crispy edges and plenty of chocolate chips. Honestly, i'd take these Chocolate Chip Cookies over almost ANY other dessert (except for ice cream ;) ).
THANKS A LOT FOR CONSIDERING MY RECIPE
